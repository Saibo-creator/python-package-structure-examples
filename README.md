# python-package-structure-examples

This repo is just a collection of several popular python packages from small(e.g. Tweepy) to complicated ones(ee.g. Numpy). The aim is to show the structure of such packages.

## To locate a package on the PC
```python
import numpy as np
print(np) 
# something like <module 'numpy' from '/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py'>
```
